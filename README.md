When you send the `/done` command, the bot will display an interactive list of your habits. Click on each habit to toggle its completion status:

## Daily Workflow

1. **Complete your habits** in real life throughout the day
2. **Report completion** by sending `/done` in the chat
3. **Click on each habit** in the interactive menu to mark it as complete
4. **Check the status** of others in your group with `/status`
5. **Receive a daily summary** automatically at the end of the day

## Understanding the Reports

### Daily Status Report

The `/status` command shows:
- Who has completed all their habits (‚úÖ)
- Who hasn't completed all habits yet (‚ùå)
- Which specific habits are still pending for each user
- How many total reports each user has missed historically

Example:
```
Today's Status:

Sezim (@sezim): ‚ùå Not done (Pending: meditation, jogging) | Missed: 5
Aidai (@aidai): ‚úÖ All done | Missed: 2
```

### Leaderboard

The `/leaderboard` command ranks users based on how reliable they are (fewer missed reports = higher rank):

Example:
```
üìä Missed Reports Leaderboard:

1. Aikanysh (@aikanysh): 2 missed
2. Torayim (@torayim): 5 missed
```

### End of Day Report

At the end of each day, the bot automatically generates a summary for the group showing:
- How many habits each person completed vs. their total
- Which specific habits were missed
- Users who miss habits will have their missed count increased

Example:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Daily Habit Report:

Adina (@adina): 1 / 3 | ‚ùå Missed: meditation, jogging
Aizhan (@aizhan): 3 / 3
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Be consistent** - Report your habits daily
2. **Use reminders** - The `/remind` command can prompt those who haven't reported yet
3. **Stay accountable** - The group format helps everyone stay motivated
4. **Review your progress** - Check the leaderboard to see your improvement over time

## Troubleshooting

- If you don't see your habits, make sure you've added them using `/addHabit`
- If the bot isn't responding, try sending `/start` again
- Make sure you type habit names exactly as they were created when removing them
- If you need to report habits for today, simply type "done" (not case-sensitive)
